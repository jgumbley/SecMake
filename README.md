# SecMake

> "Complex security workflows, elegantly orchestrated."

A Makefile-driven security operations framework for elegant AI-supported detection workflows.

## Overview

SecMake provides a minimalist approach to security operations by leveraging the power of Makefiles to orchestrate detection, analysis, and reporting workflows. Inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of tools like Snort, SecMake focuses on creating maintainable, version-controlled security processes that bridge the gap between detection rules and actionable intelligence for liability owners.

## Authentication

Before running the samples, you need to authenticate with Google Cloud. Run the following command:

```bash
make auth
```

This will open a browser window and prompt you to log in with your Google account.

To remove your stored credentials, run:

```bash
make cleanauth
```

## Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Clear workflows without unnecessary complexity
- **Composability**: Small, focused components that work well together
- **Transparency**: Open processes that can be audited and understood
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to different services and security contexts
- **Modularity**: Extend functionality without modifying core components

## Human-in-the-Loop AI Workflow

SecMake is fundamentally a human-analyst-driven framework that uses AI to enhance specific parts of the security operations process:

- **Analyst-Defined Context**: Service cards and business context are defined by human analysts, not generated by AI
- **AI-Assisted Rule Development**: AI helps translate business abuse cases into YARA-L detection rules and refine parameters
- **Human Decision Authority**: All critical security decisions remain with human analysts
- **AI-Enhanced Reporting**: AI helps contextualize technical findings for business stakeholders
- **Continuous Learning Loop**: Human feedback improves AI assistance over time

The AI component specifically focuses on:
- Rule development assistance, not direct pattern recognition
- Report generation and contextualization
- Translating technical detections into business impact statements
- Suggesting categorized actions (Protect, Respond, Recover)

## Key Features

- **Business-Oriented Security**: Align detection with business service context
- **AI-Augmented Workflows**: Leverage AI to enhance analyst capabilities
- **Accountability-Focused Reporting**: Generate actionable reports for decision support to accountable owners 
- **Rule Development Framework**: Structured approach to detection rule creation
- **Makefile Orchestration**: Leverage familiar tools for complex workflows
- **Google Security Operations (Chronicle) Integration**: Seamless API-based interactions
- **YARA-L Support**: Native support for writing and managing YARA-L detection rules
- **Complex analysis and processing**: Automate longer chain multi YARA query enrichment workflows

## Use Cases

- Develop and manage detection rules for Google Drive and other SaaS services
- Transform technical security findings into business-relevant reports
- Create consistent, repeatable security operations processes
- Maintain clear mapping between detection rules and business risks
- Generate action-oriented reports categorized by Protect, Respond, Recover
- Automate ingestion and analysis of security telemetry in Google Security Operations (Chronicle)
- Utilize YARA-L for advanced threat hunting and detection rule creation
- Extend workflows to include third-party security data sources and APIs

## Development Language Support

SecMake is designed for flexible development, with Python as the primary language for interacting with Google Security Operations (Chronicle) APIs and YARA-L. Additional support includes:

- **Python**: Preferred for Chronicle API integration, detection rule management, and automation

## Community

SecMake is an AGPL-licensed project and contributions are welcome and encouraged.

## Status

Early development - structure and approach being defined. Stay tuned for more updates and contributions.
